1.FIGHTING GAME 
I think we have to develop some game  that we like to play in our
 childhood like street fighter type game so that we can gain more
 public attention and gave them new version of fighting game which
 we can apply boosters or special power effect

2.CAR RACE 
My 2nd choice is to make aa car race game in which we can create
 mode  and different track for different type of people to play 
it and enjoy the experience

3.SNAKE GAME 
My 4th  choice is to make game is that we have to develop some 
game like snake game which can eat the multiple things and
 gain point and if we touch it self we have to lose 1 life 
so you have 2 or 3 lives to collect as much point as you can
