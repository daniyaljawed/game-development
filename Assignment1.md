# Muhammad Fahad Khan:

When I develop a game in future so it will be a game Like
CS-GO, because I'm aslo a player of CS-GO It's an amazing
game that I have ever seen in my life. The game is of 
terrorists and counter-terrorist attacks. Where players 
have to diffuse and plant the bombs, accomplish missions,
secure locations, kill the terrorist, and guard the 
hostages shown on the map. It’s a multiplayer shooter game.
CS-GO is still lies in Top 5 games in the world. CG-GO has
a separate fan base.

# Syed Hadi Raza :

If i have time in my life and get the opportunity 
to develop the game in my life so i would like to
develop the game like PUB-G , Counter Strike because many people around
World from different fields are looking for such a
Stress buster in their life and in the world of 
Internet , people dont have much time to meet their friends specially 
with those who are very far from them so they looks for video 
games in which they can play with their friends while sitting in 
their home and can chat with them so they can keep themselves fresh and
they can also connect with other unknown people so,
There would be  new experience to interact and know 
about other people around the world.
