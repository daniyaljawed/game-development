Daniyal jawed:
If i have time in my life and get the opportunity 
to develop the game in my life so i would like to
develop the game like players unknown battleground
or like couter strike because many people around
World from different fields are looking for such a
Stress buster in their life and in the world of 
Internet though this type of games we can spend some 
Quality time with our friends and from those people
Which live so far so its impossible to meet them and 
There would be  new experience to interact and know 
about other people around the world.
